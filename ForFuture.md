**Improvements**

  * This code could be improved by building a nicer webpage to house it
  
  * The Javascript Testing on the front in needs work, as well as some of the back end
  
  * UI could use some testing as well

  * The backend could connect the json it is given to the configurations file it should use automatically, we just didn't impliment this because we only had two
  

**Issues**

  * Cesium Time control will go off the rails if you let it run too long. The server needs to do a better job of managing time stamps, but you could also filter them on your end when it connects
  
  * The Server could use more rigorous testing when it connects

  * Links in READMEs will be broken after repo transfer
