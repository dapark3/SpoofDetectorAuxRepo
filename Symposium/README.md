# Experience

### Samuel Gross

I had a really great at the symposium. I got to meet a lot of new people, and people seemed very interested in our project. It was cool to see people be so fascinated by a software that has been rather normal and comfortable to me at this point. It was fun to express the idea behind our project in a shorter time frame. Our booth was a bit cramped, but we made do, and the judges were really nice.

### Logan Parker

I really enjoyed showing off the project to my parents, being able to finally show them what I had been working on for 8 months. As well, talking with the judges about the project and our futures was a nice conversation.

### Ashley Vanaman

I had fun being able to show people from outside our major what we have done. I really liked being able to see what other majors have been working on and hear about their experiences with their projects that weren't CS related. I knew that we had a pretty cool project, but it made it even better to see people who don't know much about CS to think it was as cool as we did. As much as I loved being able to show what we accomplished, I think I liked being able to see what everyone else did a bit more. 

### Michaela Walker

I had a fun experience at the student symposium. It was great to interact with people from different majors, see all the different projects, and to communicate with people interested in our project. People at the symposium were genuinely interested in other people's projects and open to any communications and listening to people's stories who relate to the projects in some way. The judges were extremely kind and genuinely interested in our project, they asked questions, gave remarks about our projects and also gave us life long guidance by giving us advice for future employment and careers.
